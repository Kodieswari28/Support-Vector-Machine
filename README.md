## 🧠 Support Vector Machines (SVM) Project

## 📌 Objective  
The goal of this project is to implement **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for both **linear** and **non-linear classification** using Scikit-learn.  
We use the **Breast Cancer dataset** for training & evaluation, and a **synthetic 2D dataset** for visualizing decision boundaries.

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib
