# Support-Vector-Machine
“This project demonstrates the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model using Python. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation and visualization of results. The goal of this project is to understand how SVM works and how it can be applied for classification problems.”
